This project is a lightweight command-line calculator inspired by Unix's bc. It supports basic arithmetic, floating-point numbers, scientific notation, and variable assignments. A standout feature is its real-time transcription of expressions into assembly-like instructions, providing insights into lexical analysis, parsing, and stack evaluation.
